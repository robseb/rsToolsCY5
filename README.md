# rstools

 **`rstools`is the source code of the *socfpgatools* of the [*meta-intelfpga*](https://github.com/robseb/meta-intelfpga) BSP-Layer**

`meta-intelfpga` is a BSP-Layer for bringing support for *Intel* (*ALTERA*) SoC-FPGAs (*SoCFPGAs*) to the *Yocto Project*.
The *socfpgatools* add a simple way for fully accessing the FPGA Manager of the Intel (*ALTERA*) Cyclone V SoC-FPGA (*SoCFPGA*).

Additionally, with a single command it is possible to read or write the *ARM AXI-Bridge* (*Lightweight HPS-to-FPGA-* (*LWHPS2FPGA*) or *HPS-to-FPGA (*HPS2FPGA*) Bridge*) to the FPGA Fabric.
It enables to check the startus of the FPGA Fabric, write or read any address of the MPU (*HPS*) Memory space or the read and write the general purpose in- (*GPI*) and output- (*GPO*) registers. 

This source code and the [*meta-intelfpga*](https://github.com/robseb/meta-intelfpga) is a part of my [*rsyocto*](https://github.com/robseb/rsyocto). A embedded Linux Distribution for *Intel* SoC-FPGAs.
